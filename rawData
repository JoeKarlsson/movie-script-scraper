<b>    EXT. MOUNT HOLLISTON - DAY                                    1
</b>    Peace.

    Fresh snow glistens in the sunlight and reflects off of the
    giant pine trees covering the serene mountain side.

    It's quiet.

    So quiet.

<b>                                                   HARD CUT TO:

<b>2   EXT. THE CHAIR LIFT - DAY                                     2
</b>    Tight on a gloved hand as a lever is released.

    Tight on the cables at the top of a rickety chair lift as
    they kick into motion.

    Wider as an empty chair swivels around and beneath the asses
    of a threesome of SKIERS.

    Even wider to reveal a long line of Skiers and SNOWBOARDERS
    awaiting their moment to step up to the chair.



    The camera finds a group of three standing off to the side of
    the line, decked out in their winter gear.



<b>3   EXT. SNOW BANK OVERLOOKING THE CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS        3
</b>
    Angle on DAN WALKER (college age, shaggy hair, holding a
    snowboard and a helmet in one hand) as he studies the
    situation. Next to him stands an impatient JOE LYNCH
    (college age, goggles on his head and a face full of fresh
    stubble, standing on skis).

<b>                          LYNCH
</b>                I don't see her.

<b>                          DAN
</b>                The shift change is late.   Just
                wait.

    PARKER O'NEIL (college age, red hair, holding a snowboard)
    sighs and stares back at the lift lane.
<b>                                                          2.
</b>


<b>                    PARKER
</b>          Are you sure about this?

<b>                    DAN
</b>          We've been doing this forever.
          Trust me. This lady loves Lynch.
          She always goes for it.



Lynch smiles at Parker.

<b>                      LYNCH
</b>          I'm cute.


Just then, JASON (a ski mountain employee) approaches the
front of the line and excuses the employee working the chair.

<b>                    PARKER
</b>          Is um... is that her?

<b>                      DAN
</b>          Shit.

<b>                      LYNCH
</b>          Dude.

<b>                    DAN
</b>          It's cool, it's cool.
              (to Parker)
          Look, all you have to do is smile
          real pretty and tell him-


<b>                     PARKER
</b>          -What?   Me? No way.    This is your
          thing.

<b>                    DAN
</b>
         Parker, listen, listen. It's so
          easy. All you do is tell the guy
          that you and your friends-

<b>                    LYNCH
</b>          -GIRLfriends. Say "girlfriends".

<b>                    DAN
</b>          -you and your girlfriends forgot
          your credit card and you can't pick
          up your lift tickets.


He grabs a wad of cash out of Lynch's glove and shoves it in
Parker's hand.
<b>                                                                 3.
</b>


                        DAN (cont'd)
              Start at $50. That's what we
              usually give the other lady. He'll
              take it. Trust me.

<b>                         PARKER
</b>              Dan, no.   You do it.    I feel
              stupid.

<b>                        DAN
</b>              You've got this.    You can totally
              do this.


<b>                        LYNCH
</b>              Parker, you've so got this.

<b>                        DAN
</b>              The worst thing that happens is he
              says no. He won't say no. No one
              ever says no.

<b>                         PARKER
</b>              Why me?

<b>                        LYNCH
</b>              `Cause you're a girl.

<b>                         DAN
</b>              A very beautiful girl with a very
              charming smile.
                  (then)

              Just...

    He unzips her jacket a little bit, showing some more of her
    body.


                         DAN (cont'd)
              There.

<b>                        PARKER
</b>              My charming smile?

    Dan and Lynch smile back at her.    She exits reluctantly
    towards the lift line.


<b>4   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - CONTINUOUS                                4
</b>    Parker pushes her snowboard forward and moves up the side of
    the line, passing all of the skiers who are waiting.

    She approaches Jason who is now running the lift.    He lights
    a cigarette.
<b>                                                           4.
</b>


<b>                      PARKER
</b>          Hey.

Jason looks up at her.

                    PARKER (cont'd)
          Could I bum a smoke?



She flashes an adorable but forced smile and he quickly
obliges with a cigarette.

                      PARKER (cont'd)
          Thanks.

He lights her cigarette.

                    PARKER (cont'd)
          I'm Parker.

He looks around, not all that sure why a cute girl is talking
to him for more than just to get a smoke.

<b>                      JASON
</b>          Jason.

<b>                      PARKER
</b>          Oh, cool.    My brother's name is
          Jason.

<b>                      JASON
</b><b>          OK.
</b>
<b>                    PARKER
</b>          Yeah, so I don't want to waste your
          time and bullshit you cause you
          seem like a wicked busy guy and
          everything...but..this is gonna
          sound so stupid...

Jason is all ears.

                    PARKER (cont'd)
          My girlfriends and I drove all the
          way up here from Salem State, and I
          was sort of the dumbass who told
          everyone that I could cover the
          lift tickets on my Mom's credit
          card...but then I left her credit
          card at the gas station...and so...

Jason totally sees where this is going.
<b>                                                              5.
</b>


<b>                          JASON
</b>              Right.

<b>                        PARKER
</b>              No- but I mean, we totally have
              some cash and stuff. We just don't
              have enough to cover all 3 lift
              tickets, you know?

    Jason exhales two lungs full of smoke as the next group gets
    onto the lift.


<b>                          JASON
</b>              How much?

<b>                        PARKER
</b>              Like...fifty?

    Jason scoffs and starts the lift.

<b>                        JASON
</b>              I could lose my job.

    He looks around.


<b>5   EXT. SNOW BANK OVERLOOKING THE CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS        5
</b>    Lynch and Dan watch Parker at work.

<b>                        LYNCH
</b>              He's not going for it.

<b>                        DAN
</b>              Will you shut up? He's gonna go
              for it. It's either stand there
              and do the job for minimal...
              minimal, what is it?

<b>                          LYNCH
</b>              Minimum.

<b>                        DAN
</b>              -Minimum wage or do it for minimum
              wage plus a little bit more.

    Lynch sighs, then changes the subject.

<b>                        LYNCH
</b>              She had to come skiing with us?

    Dan looks back at him, offended.
<b>                                                         6.

<b>                    DAN
</b>          You said you didn't mind?

<b>                     LYNCH
</b>          I don't.   I don't mind.   Don't mind
          at all.




<b>                                                    X
</b>A beat.

                    LYNCH (cont'd)
          I'm just saying, you haven't done
          dollar pitchers at Fezziwigs with

</b>directly into his face.

Parker and Dan watch from afar as Lynch helps her with her
boot strap.

He has one hand innocently on the back of her knee and he is

</b>fastening the strap with his other.

<b>                    PARKER
</b>          Aww, check out Lynch.

From their point of view, they watch Lynch helping the girl.

</b>          See?   Chick magnet.

Almost as if on cue, RYAN (an enormous dude, 20's) stomps
over and shoves Lynch down into the snow.

Lynch tries to get up.

<b>                    LYNCH
</b>          Woah! Shit, man!    I was just
          trying to help!

Instantly, Dan moves over to Lynch's aid. Parker follows
slowly behind him. She's clearly not too good on her board.

</b>          Ryan, what the hell?

</b>          No he didn't. I can take care of
          myself!

She shoves him back. Ryan just shakes his head at her and
shoves off, away from the group. He waits for her down the
hill a few feet.

He waves to Ryan.   Ryan just looks away.

She takes off after Ryan.

    boards and skis.

    Quick cuts of Dan helping Parker learn.    Lynch impatiently
    waits.




<b>      D

    claps for her.

              if they were open during the week
              I'd say we should cut class, too.

    Lynch suddenly flies over the hill and sprays both of them
    down with powder.

     Parker and Dan take off laughing while Lynch feebly tries to
     get back on his feet.

               We had to take like 3 lifts to get
               to the top and it was powder as far
               as you could see.

               get one real run in before we leave

     Dan feels bad.

     Parker is now walking back to their table behind Lynch and is
     pretty much right on top of them.

          had to now right then and there
          what kind of soup we'd prefer.

          that's not the point.

          The point is you can go a few more

 That would be worse than actually

 animal is coming for you but you
 can't get away. And that it's
 going to eat you. Like you're
 gonna get eaten alive? Have you

 great white jumping out of the
 water to eat that seal?

He puts one foot up on the top of the chair back...but it
slips off to the side.

Slowly, he wraps his arms around the wire, now with his full
body weight on the back of the chair.

The bolt holding the arm into place on the cabling starts to
creak. It bends slightly, but seems to hold firm.

The noise is almost refreshing in the silent ice covered
wilderness.

With another deep breath, Lynch moves another two feet out
over the sky. He is straining hard.

     Lynch is trying to cover Parker's ears...but she can hear
     what they are saying. She forces her head free and steals a
     glance down.

     She sees Dan's untimely death approaching and instantly
     starts to scream and cry.




<b>       D
</b>     Lynch holds her head in a vice grip. He presses his forehead
     into hers. Her tears and snot overflow onto his gloves.

               listen. Don't listen.

     As we push in tight on the two of their faces, below them we
     hear the wolves begin their attack on their defenseless prey.

     First one growl and a bite.

     Dan shrieks in pain.

     bites get more frequent and his screams even more painful.

     The sound of several wolves attacking in unison over powers
     his cries.

</b>     Lynch continues to hold his hands over Parker's ears and keep
     her eyes pointed at his as the sounds of Dan's demise echo
     through the night.

     The sounds of clothes being shredded, flesh being torn, and

     own frozen gloves as Parker hysterically screams out into the
     night.

     They are now in the devastating silence that has fallen after
     what must have been endless screaming and crying. Only the
     occasional sniffle lets us know that they are even awake.

      Lynch is numb.    He sits expressionless.   Seething.

      In her crying, Parker slowly keeps moving towards him. Like
      a puppy who knows they did something wrong and only wants you
      to love it again.

      Finally she gets next to him and buries her head in his

      Eventually, Lynch can't help but feel compassion for her.    He
      puts his arm around her.

     lost in the wet snowfall and darkness.

</b>     Dawn is breaking over the trees.

     Lynch and Parker are still. Their bodies are huddled




<b>                            M
</b>     together, but neither is moving.

     In fact, at a first glance, one might think they are both
     human popcycles.

     The dark splotches of frost-bite on Parker's nose and cheeks
     have now grown to what almost looks like patches of black
     fungus on her skin.




<b>       D
</b>     Lynch has the start of his own frost-bite on his ears and
     nose.

     Slowly, Parker's eyes flutter and she awakens.




<b>     E
</b>     Her eyes search around as the realization that this was not
     all just a bad dream sinks in.

     She adjusts in her seat and feels something pull. She winces
     and looks down. Slowly the camera follows her stare down to
     reveal her bare hand, gripping the icy safety bar.

     She pulls...but her skin is stuck to the frozen metal.

     Beginning to panic, she jerks her hand hard, taking the bar
     up about half an inch with it.

<b>                         PARKER
</b>               Uhh...

</b>


Painstakingly slow, she begins to peel her hand off of the
bar.

A sound that resembles `jeans slowly tearing' can be softly
heard as she moves her arm forward and separates her hand
from the skin that is attached to the metal.




<b>                                                  X
</b>After what feels like an eternity, she gives her hand one
last jerk, freeing it from the safety bar.

from a `falling nightmare'.

Discombobulated, Lynch turns back and forth frantically

Parker is crying and holding her bloody hand,

          Shhhh.




<b>                       M
</b>Lynch, bug-eyed, takes in the world around him.

A fresh coat of snow has covered everything in several inches
of peaceful white bliss.

Below them, the snow has completely covered Dan's remains.
There is nothing left to show that there was ever even a

Parker hides her bloody hand back inside of her coat, away
from Lynch's eyes.

He turns to look at Parker. It takes everything he has to
not jolt back in horror at how bad her face looks.

</b>          What?

<b>                    LYNCH

He looks around, front to back.   In daylight it's easier to
see the other chairs.

His breath blows out of his body in huge plumes of mist.

          going to come up here, even though
          they're not open today?

Lynch doesn't respond. The look on his face says that "no

a little while longer.

Lynch tries to yell for help again, though his soar throat is
making it almost impossible to scream.

          out of this position for a minute.

</b>     Lynch is sleeping. His head is leaned to one side in a
     position that is sure to give him the worst stiff neck he's
     ever had.

     Parker is ancy.    She looks all around.   Thinking.

     Finally she squeezes her eyes shut...embarrassed.

     Her snow pants turn dark around her bottom. Slowly a puddle
     of urine forms on the chair between her and Lynch.

     Below them, the urine falls into the snow and disappears.

     Parker's eyes swell as she begins to cry what's left of her
     tears. She is emotionally degraded and devastated.

     As her nose begins to run, she instinctively wipes her hand
     across it...taking a small piece of the dead flesh off of her
     cheek with it.

     She doesn't even feel it.

</b>     The two are bundled together as the evening winds start to
     pick up.

     Again, they speak without emotion. It's conversation just to
     let themselves know that they are still alive.

<b>                         PARKER
</b>               How come you never have a
               girlfriend?

<b>                         LYNCH
</b>               How am I supposed to answer that?

<b>           PARKER
</b> I mean, you're a decent guy. Girls
 dig you. But you never stay in a
 relationship.

<b>           LYNCH
</b> I had a serious girlfriend once.

</b><b>           PARKER
</b> High School doesn't count.

<b>           LYNCH
</b>



<b>                                       R
</b> No, post-high school.   Freshmen
 year.

<b>           PARKER
</b> Who?




<b>                             A
</b><b>           LYNCH
</b> This girl Annie. I met her at
 orientation. We emailed all summer
 and when we started school, it was
 like we were already going out. I




<b>              M
</b> totally just felt it with her, you
 know? We were into a lot of the
 same stuff, which was cool. She
 was way into Aerosmith. I had seen
 them fifteen times, she had seen
 them twenty. How cool is that?

<b>           PARKER
</b>



<b>  D
</b> What happened?

<b>           LYNCH
</b> She um... same favorite movie as
 me. E.T. It was like soul mates




<b>E
</b> and that stuff you read about.

<b>           PARKER
</b> So then... what happened?

<b>            LYNCH
</b> Same old shit.
     (then)
 No. You know what happened? She
 liked another guy. This fucking
 fraternity douchebag named Dean who
 kept sending her flowers and stuff.
 I don't know who it was exactly,
 but every time I'd go to her room
 some guy named "Dean" had left her
 notes and shit.
<b>                                        84.
</b>


<b>           PARKER
</b> Why did she keep it? Was she
 trying to make you jealous?

<b>           LYNCH
</b> I don't know. I think she just
 liked getting attention.




<b>                                        X
</b><b>           PARKER
</b> So she dumped you for a frat guy?

<b>             LYNCH
</b>



<b>                                      R
</b> No. I dumped her. We were in the
 cafeteria, right? And I was
 sitting facing her, facing the
 wall...and she was facing everyone
 in the cafeteria behind me. And I




<b>                          A
</b> kept seeing her smiling at someone
 behind me and like, almost
 laughing. So I was like, "who are
 you laughing at?" You know? Like
 "what the hell is going on?" And
 she's like, "Dean's making fun of




<b>              M
</b> you."
      (beat)
 So I turn around, and I'm like
 ready to kick the shit out of this
 guy. And all I see is a sea of
 fucking random people. Just all of
 these faces. This guy could see me
 and was making eyes with my




<b>  D
</b> girlfriend...but I couldn't see
 him.

<b>           PARKER
</b> That's messed up.




<b>E
</b><b>            LYNCH
</b> I've never felt so stupid and bad
 in my life.
     (then)
 So I left.

<b>           PARKER
</b> You just walked out?

<b>           LYNCH
</b> Yup. Told her to go laugh with
 "Dean the Frat guy". I was out.

<b>           PARKER
</b> That sucks.

</b>


<b>                    LYNCH
</b>          Maybe... maybe I shouldn't have
          been so quick to walk out. Maybe I
          needed to have a thicker skin and
          not be such a sensitive bitch, I
          don't know. Sometimes I think I
          was just insecure and maybe I




<b>                                                  X
</b>          screwed up.

<b>                    PARKER
</b>          You should call her. When you get
          home. You could tell her that.




<b>                                                R

              (laughs)
          She's dating Dean.




<b>                                   A
</b>Emotion has fought it's way to the surface again.   Parker and
Lynch share a nervous laugh together.

She turns away from him.




<b>                       M
</b>After a few seconds, her laughs turn to tears.

<b>                    PARKER
</b>          I should have done something.

<b>                    LYNCH
</b>          There was nothing either of us
          could have done.




<b>  D
</b><b>                    PARKER
</b>          I sat here and let him die.

<b>                    LYNCH
</b>



<b>E
</b>          No, you didn't. We didn't let him
          die. There was nothing we could
          have done. He jumped down there to
          try and save us, OK?

<b>                    PARKER
</b>          He was the one. He was the boy I
          was gonna marry.

<b>                    LYNCH
</b>          Funny story. First grade, we all
          get left there for the day by our
          mom's. You know, alone in real
          school for the first time without
          our folks around. And Dan... Dan
          was this sort of chubby kid when he
          was little...

Parker laughs.

                    LYNCH (cont'd)
          Nah, fuck it. He was a fat ass.

Parker laughs harder.




<b>                                                    X
</b>                    LYNCH (cont'd)
          And all the mom's left and he just
          wouldn't let go of his mom's hand.
          He just stood there after she left,
          at the front of the room, crying




<b>                                                  R
</b>          like a total pussy.

<b>                    PARKER
</b>          Sounds like Dan.

</b><b>                    LYNCH

          teacher... Mrs... What was her
          name? Mrs. Schifrin? She was
          trying everything to get the fat
          kid to stop crying. And so she




<b>                          M
</b>          says, "Well Dan, is there anyone
          else in the class that you know?"
          You know, like, "Maybe there's a
          friend you'd like to sit with?"
          And the fucker points right at me
          and says "him"! I had never seen
          this kid before in my life, you
          know? But for whatever reason, he




<b>  D
</b>          points right at me.

<b>                    PARKER
</b>          And so he had to sit with you?




<b>E
</b><b>                    LYNCH
</b>          For a week! For my whole first
          week of school I'm sharing my
          little cubby desk with his fat ass!

Parker laughs through her tears.

                       LYNCH (cont'd)
          Douchebag.     I never let him forget
          it.

<b>                    PARKER
</b>          I loved him so much.

Lynch is determined.
<b>                                                               87.
</b>


<b>                         LYNCH
</b>               But if he died only for you and me
               to give up and die up here, that's
               bullshit.

<b>                         PARKER
</b>               Yes.

</b>     Lynch bites his severely chapped lips.

<b>                         LYNCH
</b>               Help me up.

<b>                                                       CUT TO:

</b><b>77   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - MOMENTS LATER                              77
</b>     Lynch feebly climbs up on the chair back and reaches up for
     the cables.

<b>                         LYNCH
</b>



<b>       D
</b>               OK....let's try this again.

     He steadies himself on the chair, which sways in the wind.

     TIGHT ON the bolts connecting the arm to the cables.   The




<b>     E
</b>     metal is bending with a light squeaking sound.

<b>                         PARKER
</b>               Are you OK? Do you have it?

     Lynch just grunts as he reaches and tries to steady himself
     on the chair that is swinging at an odd angle under his
     weight.

     The camera swivels up to reveal his shaky feet trying to find
     footing on the chair back and the ground far below him.

<b>                         LYNCH
</b>               Rrruh!

     He pushes off hard and grabs on to the cabling.
<b>                                                             88.
</b>


As his foot pushes fast on the chair, it swings at an
impossible angle.

TIGHT ON the connecting bolts as one of them SNAPS!

<b>                         PARKER
</b>          Oh my god!




<b>                                                   X
</b>The chair leans hard to the right side, forcing Parker to
slide down into what is now the bottom corner of the chair.

The chair is still in place, but it is now hanging by one




<b>                                                 R
</b>bolt and at a severe angle.

                         PARKER (cont'd)
          Joe!    JOE!




<b>                                           A
</b>Joe tries to look back over his shoulder, struggling to keep
himself on the cable against his own body weight and wet
clothing.

<b>                      LYNCH
</b>          Shit!    Hold on, just hold on!




<b>                            M
</b>Another grunt and Lynch makes another big move forward.

The camera booms up above him, shooting straight down at the
distance between his dangling body and the frozen ground.

Tight on his gloved hands as they slowly slide forward on the
metal cable.




<b>  D
</b>Lynch squeezes his eyes shut and takes another reach forward.

Behind him, Parker looks on in agony.      She is holding her
breath and whispering...




<b>E
</b><b>                    PARKER
</b>              (whispered)
          Please God...please God....please
          God...

The metal arm above her groans under the pressure that the
one remaining bolt is under. Looking at the arm in this
state, it is especially eerie to imagine how these metal
chairs even stay attached to the cables in the first place.

Lynch takes another move forward.

<b>                         LYNCH
</b>          Rrrugh!
<b>                                                         89.
</b>


<b>                    PARKER
</b>          You can do it. Please do it.

Lynch reaches forward again...and his hand slips on the icy
cable. He momentarily hangs by one arm.

<b>                      LYNCH
</b>



<b>                                               X
</b>          Arrrrr!

<b>                      PARKER
</b><b>          JOE!
</b>



<b>                                             R
</b>He reaches up and grabs hold again...his strength is weaning.

<b>                    LYNCH
</b>              (through gritted teeth)
          Got it.




<b>                                     A
</b>Another few quick reaches forward and he is more than halfway
across to the next chair.

From Lynch's point of view we can see his feet floating above
the earth and hear the sound of his own heart beat. His own




<b>                         M
</b>pained breathing fills his ears.

It's only now that he sees two of the wolves watching him
from the bushes.

                    LYNCH (cont'd)
          Motherfucker.




<b>  D
</b>The wind blows hard against him, swaying his body back and
forth as he momentarily rests.

                    LYNCH (cont'd)
          I've got an audience.




<b>E
</b>Parker looks down, just in time to see one of the wolves duck
back into the bushes.

Her movement makes the chair groan harder. The cable twangs
loudly between Lynch's shaky movements and the twisted metal
that holds the arm in place.

<b>                    PARKER
</b>          The chair is gonna fall!

<b>                      LYNCH
</b>          No.    No it's not.

Slowly he makes his way the remaining distance and positions
himself over the other chair.
<b>                                                          90.
</b>


He drops down onto it, sending shards of ice cascading down
into the snow below.

He quickly sits down, breathing heavy and clutching the sides
of the chair.

                       LYNCH (cont'd)




<b>                                                    X
</b>             Take that Jenny Bluth!

<b>                       PARKER
</b>             You made it!




<b>                                                  R
</b><b>                        LYNCH
</b>             Not yet.   Halfway.

He looks behind him at the next chair. Just a few feet back
from it is the giant green lift pole... and a ladder!




<b>                                         A
</b>                        LYNCH (cont'd)
             Please.

He stands up on the chair and reaches up to the cable.   He is
weak.




<b>                           M
</b>Very weak.

                       LYNCH (cont'd)
             Parker. I want you to throw my
             extra pole as far as you can this
             way.




<b>  D
</b>She can't quite hear him.

<b>                        PARKER
</b>             What?




<b>E
</b><b>                       LYNCH
</b>             I said THROW MY POLE AS FAR AS YOU
             CAN THIS WAY. When I get on the
             ground I'll need some defense.

Parker nods.

She takes Lynch's ski pole and tries to throw it as far as
she can back at him.

The action forces another terrifying metallic groan from the
arm above her, and her chair swings back and forth from the
motion.

<b>                        PARKER
</b>             Oh shit.
<b>                                                           91.

The pole lands under the second chair, splitting the distance
between where she is and where the tree is.

                     PARKER (cont'd)
          Sorry.

<b>                    LYNCH
</b>



<b>                                                X
</b>          Hey. Halfway to me is better than
          up there with you, right?
              (to himself)
          Shit.




<b>                                              R
</b>He starts to pull himself up again, but turns back to Parker
one more time.

The chair has settled down.




<b>                                       A
</b>                    LYNCH (cont'd)
          Stay perfectly still. I'm gonna
          get you home, OK?

He pulls himself up, straining hard.




<b>                        M
</b>                     LYNCH (cont'd)
          Rrrrugh!

This gets the wolves attention.

In the bushes their ears and eyes perk up to the sky,
watching their potential next meal grapple with the high wire
cable.




<b>  D
</b>With reserved strength, Lynch shimmies across the cable as
quickly as he can.

Back at Parker's chair, she eyes the bending metal bolt that




<b>E
</b>is keeping her from plunging to the ground.

Tears stream down her face again.

<b>                    PARKER
</b>              (whispered)
          Please god, don't let me fall.
          Don't let me fall.

He stops once to catch his breath, but begins moving as
quickly as possible.

Finally, he reaches the second chair behind them and drops
down into it.

Looking at the lift pole from this position, he can clearly

Parker is buried in the corner of the chair closest to the
ground, holding on to the back of it to keep herself steady.

</b>Stoically, Lynch turns away from her and takes a deep breath.

He climbs up onto the chair back and looks down.

Parker closes her eyes and prays.

The wolves below do not break their stare.   Their hungry eyes
are willing Lynch to fall from the chair.

It's now or never.

     He lands and hooks his arm around a rung. With a SNAP his
     arm dislocates from it's socket, but he is hooked on to the

     He feels his body for damage, wincing at what can only be a

     and by the look on Lynch's face, it must be either broken or

     beings to lower herself, inch by inch, off of the side.

     Parker and the pack leader lock eyes.

     Finally, the leader turns away from Parker, back to his food.

     Back to his family.

     Though her face is emotionless, Parker's eyes are swollen
     with tears as she continues on her way down the mountain
     side.

     She is free.

     Parker continues down the treacherous trail as the snow falls
     around her.

     Occasionally she hits bumps and turns that cause her to spill
     from her awkward coat/sled...but she pulls herself back on
     and continues to make her way down the hill stoically.

<b>90   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - LATER                                 90
</b>     Parker reaches the bottom of the hill.

     Grunting and crying from the pain, she crawls over on her
     belly and begins to drag herself towards the parking lot.

     Just as she gets there....




<b>                                                    X
</b>     BEEP! A HONKING CAR races past with it's windshield wipers
     blaring.

     Narrowly missing being splattered, she collapses in the dirty
     road.


     There are no more cars to be seen.

     She is alone.

     And then...

     Another car approaches in the distance.

     She holds her hand up weakly.

<b>                          PARKER
</b>               Please.   Stop.

</b>     A DRIVER (male, 50's) is cautiously driving down the wet icy
     road. He reaches down to adjust the radio.


     He looks back up to reveal Parker's body in the road in front
     of him.


<b>93   EXT. ROADSIDE - CONTINUOUS                                    93
</b>     He swerves with a loud SKID!

     Partially off the road in a skid, his car comes to a stop.

     Instantly he jumps out and runs to the body on the road.

<b>                          DRIVER
</b>               Hey!   Are you OK?!   Hello!

     Parker is not moving.
<b>                                                               102.

     He runs over to her side.

                          DRIVER (cont'd)
               Lady.   Are you alright?

     Parker looks up at him and starts to cry with relief.




<b>                                                      X

               Hold on, hold on- we're gonna get
               you help...

     He lifts her up into his arms and races her back to his car.

     The driver drives frantically, speaking into his cell phone.

<b>                         DRIVER
</b>                   (into phone)
               I don't know. I found her laying
               in the road alone. Looks like she
               was in some sort of accident.
               Right outside of Mount Holliston.
               I'm taking her to you now.

     Through the passenger side window we see Parker's blank face.

     If we didn't know better, we'd think she was a rotten cadaver
     at this point.

     Reflected in the glass are the lights of a PAPA GINO'S
     restaurant store front that goes past.

     Her eyes blink at the sign.

<b>                         DRIVER
</b>               Hold on, Ma'am. The hospital is 10
               minutes away. You're gonna be OK.

     The camera is tighter on her eyes.

                         DRIVER (cont'd)
               You're gonna be OK.

     Tight on just one eye.
<b>                                                 103.

                    DRIVER (cont'd)
              (now in Dan's voice)
          You're gonna be OK, baby.

Her eye closes.
